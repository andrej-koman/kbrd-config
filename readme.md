# Keyboard config

My custom keyboard config, forked from the Mechboards pro version
Improvements todo:
- Find out how to still be able to hold j, k, l while using vim without triggering home row mods
- Figure out if its possible to holde raise and for tab to be alt + tab instead of only tab
- Find the apostrof and bind it to top left
